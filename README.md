# Password Generator Exercise [HW#3]
 
 Solution URL: https://johnk9000.github.io/HW3/
 
 In this exercise we generated a password between 8 and 128 characters in length defined via the input of a pop-up prompt.

 Sequentially, the program will ask `yes` or `no` for 'Case Sensitivity' (adds capital letters), 'Alphanumeric' (adds numbers), and 'Special Characters' (implicit) in that order.

 This will then generate the character set that satisfies the parameters specified.

 User will click the `Generate Password` button which triggers the series of functions that generates the password, and writes it into the textbox.

## Debugging
Please goto 'Develop/script.dev1.js' to read annotations and run debugging on console.  Logs will be generated as necessary for the following custom functions:

* RandomInt(max) - random integer generator.

* Password Generator Draft - recursion used to test and display contents of character sets.

* generatePassword() - generation of password within specified parameters.

* Conditional tree - console will display which condition block satisfied requirements.


## Release Notes

* Version 1 is live! Enjoy!
